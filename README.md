### What I did
I tried to make a landing page that informs users how to become a middle schooler (from 2010). 
The landing page talks about various articles of clothing, songs, and activities to participate in if the user
wants to reminise the good old days, or generally become a cooler individual. 

I made a navbar with a desktop and mobile version. I also dynamically sized the pages for the mobile version as well.
I also included a searchbar for myspace user input. 

#### What Worked
I was able to fiddle around with hover states to create some CSS transitions. The nav bar displays a line when
the user hovers over the various buttons. 

I was also able to create a hamburger menu for the mobile version using the CSS checkbox hack. 

I created a responsive button by creating two different buttons on Figma and using the z-index to stack them on top
of each other and display them depending on the hover state. 

#### What Did Not Work 
I was unable to shade in the images when I hovered over them. 

I was also unable to implement snap-scrolling. I watched various youtube videos, and I think I needed to structure my html
slightly differently where I would have a parent container and various child divs. Then I would need to use "scroll-snap-align"
on the parent and "scroll-snap-points-y" on the children divs. 

### Layout Stage

### Special Parts 

I added some fancier CSS transitions using the hover states on the call to action button and the navigation bar. 
I used the CSS Checkbox Hack.
I linked the headers to different parts of the page. 

### URL to Original Landing Page I was Mimicking

I took aspects from various landing pages. I confirmed with Tim that this was okay.
